IBM has an enormous library of freely available documentation.  The underlying
z/VM environment is approachable described in: 

    Getting Started with z/VM for Linux

    http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsx0c31.pdf

Which is IBM document  SC24-6194-06 (August 2017)

In one of the discussion and community (and professional but free) support
mailing lists, that work was described by an IBM professional on one the
freely available mailing lists thus:

> One of the simplest is the Getting Started with z/VM for Linux manual that
> is part of the z/VM library.  It was intended as a basic fishing lesson,
> as opposed to just handing you fishing


    In IBM documentation identification, the last two digits indicate the
revision level of the document, here: -06 and was released, not
unexpectedly, in August 2017

There is something of acquiring a new skill in reading IBM documentation. 
They were said to be the third largest publisher of originally authored
document in the US, behind the US Department of Defense, and the Boy Scouts
of America.  Not surprising, each of the three is in the business of
training people from wholly ignorant of a field, to full competence. 
Reading the (fine manual) documentation is to learn from professionally
designed, and maintained training materials.  That said, as the
documentation cannot assay your particular level of competence in an area,
it has to have parts that you 'already know', and may safely skip over

## Mailing lists

As intimated, there are several mailing lists to which one may freely
subscribe, read, watch discussion between professionals, and so to learn.
