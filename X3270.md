# X3270

X3270 is an application program available for desktop/laptop Linux
which emulates an IBM 3270 family terminal. X3270 is the reference
3270 emulator in the ZNETBOOT package. It is not the only 3270
emulator available.

X3270 uses TELNET protocol to connect to your z/VM host.
It can use traditional unprotected cleartext TELNET or can use
SSL-enabled or SSL-always modes. (SSL is recommended)

## Using X3270

If you don't already have X3270 installed on your laptop/desktop
Linux system, find it using your package manager and install it.
You can then connect to z/VM with a command like ...

    x3270 myvmhost.mydomain

If z/VM TELNET is listening on an alternate port,
you can specify that ...

    x3270 myvmhost.mydomain 1234

 ... where `myvmhost.mydomain` is the z/VM system
and `1234` is the port to use. SSL negotiation should be automatic.

There are real 3270 terminals in use.

## Click to Focus

Be aware that click to focus may also affect the 3270 cursor.

The usual way of directing focus to an X application
is by clicking anywhere in the application's window.
Some applications are sensitive and may use the click
for their own pointing. This is true of X3270.

In case 3270 input has been incorrectly re-focused,
use the \<Tab\> key to re-focus to the correct input field.

There is no way to show the locations of the fields
on a 3270 screen, whether emulated or physical.

Using a 3270 interface is a bit like using a web form.

## 3270 Layout

Once logged on, z/VM divides your 3270 screen into three areas:
output from your guest operating system (most of the screen),
input to your guest operating system (the bottom two lines),
and a status area (far right of the bottom line).

## 3215 Typewriter

z/VM uses its 3270 interface to present a virtual 3215 line-mode terminal.
Think typewriter terminal. Think IBM Selectric. This model persists
for reasons which are beyond the scope of this document, but it is
worth noting that there are bypass modes where your virtual machine
can drive the 3270 in full-screen mode.

Linux can drive 3270 terminals directly. When it does, it too
simulates a line-mode terminal when presenting to most applications.
Linux too has ways of bypassing line-mode operation and going
full-screen.

## Got VM READ?

z/VM uses your 3270 session according to its own rules.
One of those rules is that the lower right corner displays status
"RUNNING", "VM READ", "CP READ", "MORE...", or "HOLDING".

## Linend Character

The default linend character is pound sign (#).
While it would mean a comment in a Unix or Linux shell,
on z/VM it is the equivalent of the semi-colon in the shell.

While "#" by itself in the middle of a command in a shell means
"all that follows is a comment", on z/VM it means "all that follows
is the next line".

The linend character can be changed.

`#cp` is mentioned elsewhere as a way to enter CP commands
from your z/VM virtual console (from your 3270 session).
The intercept is actually \<linend>\CP.

## No Control Characters

If you are accustomed to Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E and other hotkey short-cuts for
command-line editing, you will be frustrated at first with the 3270.
Whether physical or emulated, a 3270 is a block-mode device.
Control characters may have meaning to your 3270 emulator,
but they are not passed to the remote system. Any editing effects
are isolated to your local screen. The resulting command is sent to
z/VM when an action key is pressed. (Usually \<Enter\>.)

You can usually jump to the start of your command-line with the \<Tab\>
key. A hotkey to jump to the end of the command-line would vary from one
3270 emulator to another. Many 3270 emulators have an "erase to end of
field" hotkey.
